# Interlinear (Alpha version, codename _Bible_)
The project **Interlinear** aims to create software to ease formatting interlinear texts using _LaTeX_ software.

The current program (codename _Bible_) is designed to create a polished interlinear New Testament text from Greek to Catalan. But we are working too in a new GUI version with more capabilities.

We intend to bring computing technologies to humanistic research in order to improve and simplify workflows in big projects such as proofreading, composing dictionaries, composing interlinear works, etc.

This project started like a friend's favour, but we would like a improve it and seek new possibilities.
